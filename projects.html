		<h2 tabindex="-1">Slack API</h2>
			<p>For a class in Fall 2018, we had an open ended final project. We could utilize any online platform's API to make our own python program. In my project, I used the API of the messaging platform, Slack. I read through my group chat's history and counted how many times a certain phrase was said, and by which user. The program counted the numbers and returned them in a car graph form.</p>

		<h2>Grocery Calculator</h2>
			<p>For a personal project, I wanted to automate the process my roommates and I went through every month when we split our grocery expenses. We had several reciepts, paid for by different people, and it was a very long process to calculate who owed what by hand. I wrote this program in C++ to make this process easier. </p>
