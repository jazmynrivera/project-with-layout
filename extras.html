			<p>In the Winter Semester of 2018, artist Chico MacMutrie came to the University of Michigan for a residency. He built of team of students from all school at the university to construct an art sculpture that was deployed at the U.S. Mexico Border. The sculpture is a robotic arm that extends up 50ft and over to form an arc. The piece was a commentary on borders, and how a wall could not stop the sharing of culture, language and community between countries.</p>

			<p>In the summer of 2017, as part of Women in Science and Engineering (WISE), we ran a camp for middle school girls interested in science and engineering. The girls rotated through several workshops of biology, physics, chemistry and electrical. I ran the electrical workshop, in which the girls contructed an LED watch from scratch. I taught the girls the basics of circuitry and soldering.</p>
